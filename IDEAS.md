- It's like delving in PoE
- Each room is its own self-contained fight
  - You are reset to max health/mana/other resources at the start of each fight
  - Delve deeper for a harder challenge, be careful, there's no going up!
  - Move sideways to keep grinding on the same difficulty
- Permadeath, but there are items to help
  - An item to "go back in time" and restart the fight
  - An item to randomly teleport you elsewhere (but never down)
  - (?) Special wearable items that can passively teleport/restart when health < 20%
  - Because it's permadeath, make sure that there's no 1-hit-kill mechanics anywhere in the game
  - Because it's permadeath, make sure you don't die due to bad internet -- a bad connection
    should have the same effect as just starting the fight over again
- No health recovery or potions by any means, that only encourages one-hit-kill mechanics
  - Exception: Perhaps a rare unique item that recovers health once-per-fight... so essentially a 100% increased health bonus
